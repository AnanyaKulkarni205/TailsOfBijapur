            What Adoption Means for Animals
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Many animals awaiting adoption have faced abandonment, injury, or unsafe
            environments. Adoption offers them safety, medical care, nourishment, and
            the chance to experience love and dignity in a permanent home.

            Adopt, Don’t Shop
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Commercial breeding often prioritizes profit over animal welfare and
            contributes to overpopulation. Adoption reduces the burden on shelters
            and supports ethical, compassionate treatment of animals.

            The Responsibility of a Pet Parent
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Adopting a pet is a long-term commitment. Responsible pet parents ensure
            regular meals, clean water, timely veterinary care, daily exercise,
            emotional attention, and a safe living environment throughout the
            animal’s life.

            Life After Adoption
          </h2>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Every adopted animal needs time to adjust to a new environment and
            unfamiliar surroundings. A calm, patient approach helps them feel safe
            during this transition period.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Maintaining consistent routines for feeding, walks, and rest creates a
            sense of stability. Positive reinforcement strengthens trust and builds
            confidence without fear or pressure.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-900 font-semibold text-lg mt-6">
            Adoption is not a single moment. It is a lifelong relationship built on
            trust, patience, and unconditional care.
